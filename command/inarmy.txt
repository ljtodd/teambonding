They say that in the Army, the chicken's mighty fine
One jumped off the table and started marking time
Oh Lord I wanna go
But they won't let me go home (stomp)
They say that in the Army, the coffee's mighty fine
It looks like muddy water, and tastes like turpentine
They say that in the Army, the shoes are mighty fine
You ask for size eleven, they give you size nine
They say that in the Army, the pancakes are mighty fine
You can try to chew them, but you're only wasting time
They say the in the Army, the mail is so great
Today I got a letter dates 1948
They say that in the Army, the hours are just right
Start early in the morning and work on through the night
They say that in the Army, the coffee's mighty fine
It's good for cuts and bruises and tastes like iodine
They say that in the army, the tents are waterproof
You wake up in the morning and you're floating on the roof
